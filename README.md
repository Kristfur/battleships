# Battleships

Battleships is a strategy guessing game where two players go head-to-head trying to sink the oppontnts ships before their ships are sunk. It is played on a grid of squares where each player takes turns guessing a coordinate on the grid, and the other player responds with 'Hit' or 'Miss'. The first player to correctly guess the position of the opposing player's ship is the winner.
